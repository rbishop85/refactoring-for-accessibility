## Final Thoughts:

This made for a great first project because it got us thinking about the side of coding that isn't always obvious just from looking at a site.  Learning to keep code clean, organized and easy for someone else to follow.  Also giving thought to people that may be trying to view the site that need a little extra help to understand the contents that some of us take for granted.  I think these are all great things to start with so you can make sure to automatically incorporate them as you move forward into actually creating your own code/content as a developer.
